# Our Place
Looking to update your kitchen essentials? Check out this email template! This project allowed me explore the world of HTML Email templates and new 
techinques to utilize HTML & CSS. Creating email templates is different from creating a regular website and 
it was intersting to learn how to work within the constraints of HTML tables only. Also, it made me consider 
responsiveness with every section created because usually, I would work on it at the end of a project.

# What I Learned 
* Inline CSS is preferred over a seperate CSS/SCSS file
* 6-Digit hex codes need to be used since they are the only codes univesally supported 
* Stacking tables instead of using divs to create new sections
